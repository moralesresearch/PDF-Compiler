# PDF Compiler version 2.0
A Python GUI program that compiles multiple PDF files into one PDF. We have rewritten the user interface from the 
built-in Python's tkinter library to PyQt6 instead as we shift to more complex code integration and writing.

## Release 1.1
Initial introduction of PDF Compiler v1.0 under the 1.1 git versioning system. This version introduces the core and 
essential parts of a functioning PDF combiner for multiple files.

## Release 1.1.2
Implements the functionality of PDF compression of the dummy checkbox "PDF compression" and makes minor changes in moving
documents up and down the list

## Release 2.0 (Dec 2023)
Introduce a preview window for the PDFs, page selection, merge specific pages (for multipaged PDFs), and drag-n'-drop 
functionality. A rewrite of the user interface from tkinter (Python's default library) to PyQt 6, as our code becomes a 
bit more complex. Removal of PDF compression (for now).
